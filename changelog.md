- Enabled pan and zoom functionality for the school map. The `SchoolMap.kt` file was modified to include `detectTransformGestures` within the `pointerInput` modifier. This allows users to pinch to zoom and drag to pan the map. The zoom level is clamped to prevent excessive scaling, and the map's offset is constrained to keep it within view. A `userInteracted` flag was also introduced to ensure that the initial location-based centering and zooming do not interfere with subsequent manual user interactions.
