## Project Title
# **NPAL2 — Android Mobile Application Re-Design**
NPal2 - Ngee Ann Polytechnic 

A Central Pulse, Within Reach

---

## 1. Introduction & Purpose
The NPAL2 platform serves as a key digital interface for Ngee Ann Polytechnic students, providing access to academic resources, administrative services, and campus-related information. However, the existing NPAL2 mobile application and respective web platform are often fragmented and inconsistent, resulting in a disjointed user experience. 
Students must navigate multiple systems to perform basic tasks such as checking timetables, managing assignments, accessing campus facilities, or viewing announcements. Furthermore, the current application interface is outdated and lacks modern usability features expected by today’s mobile users.

---

## 2. Motivation & Objectives

### Motivation
- The exisiting NPAL2 mobile application and the NPAL website are **inconsistent**.
- The User Interface is **outdated**.

### Objectives
- Unify the NP student experience into **one application**.
- Improve accessbility and daily utility.

#### 3.2 Task Management
Allows student to track assignments, projects, and personal tasks, with reminders and deadlines to faciliate productivity and planning.
### 4. Campus Navigation & Facilities

#### 4.1 Interactive Campus Map
Provides a detailed, interactive map of the campus with navigation features, showing locations of classrooms, labs, administrative offices, and amenities.
### 5. Notifications & Alerts
Sends real-time updates about timetable changes, announcements, deadlines, and campus alerts/information, ensuring students stay informed about important events.
### 6. Security & Account Protection

#### 6.1 Encrypted Login
Ensures that all login and personal data are encrypted, safeguarding student information from unauthorised access.
#### 6.2 Biometric Authentication

## 7. LLM Usage Declaration
For the development phase of the assignment, our team plans to use a Large Language Model, specifically, ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini) in this case, to provide guidance, suggest coding or design approaches, and help structure technical documentation. 

All outputs from the LLM will be reviewed, adapted, and verified by team members to ensure they accurately reflect our understanding and project direction. The LLM will serve strictly as a supportive tool, and all final coding, design, and implementation will be done by the team.
