The map in `SchoolMap.kt` has been updated to allow panning and zooming. The `pointerInput` modifier now includes `detectTransformGestures` to handle pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan. The scale is clamped between 0.5x and 5x, and the offset is clamped to keep the map within the view bounds. A `userInteracted` flag was introduced to ensure that the initial location-based zooming from `LaunchedEffect` does not override manual user interaction.
